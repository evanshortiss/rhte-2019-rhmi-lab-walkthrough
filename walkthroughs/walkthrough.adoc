= Create an Ordering Processing Pipeline


In this walkthrough you will create an end-to-end solution for processing
Orders using the Red Hat Managed Integration.

Red Hat Managed Integration is built on OpenShift Dedicated and includes Red
Hat Agile Integration and Red Hat Open Application Runtimes as hosted managed
services.

The image below illustrates the architecture you will create throughout this
walkthrough.

The high-level flow in the architecture is described below:

. Customer places an order via Order API.
.. The API microservice is protected using Red Hat 3scale AMP
.. A single `POST /order` endpoint is exposed
.. Customers must include their API Key in requests
. The API microservice forwards incoming orders to AMQ
.. AMQ exposes a queue over an AMQP interface
.. Orders are stored in the queue until Fuse Online can process them
. Fuse Online will dequeue and process each message in services
.. Processing a message involves writing it to PostreSQL
.. Fuse Online will provide metrics for processing of messages
. etc
